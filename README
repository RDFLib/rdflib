RDFLib is a Python library for working with RDF, a simple yet powerful language for representing information.

The library contains parsers and serializers for RDF/XML, N3,
NTriples, Turtle, TriX and RDFa . The library presents a Graph
interface which can be backed by any one of a number of Store
implementations. 

This core rdflib package includes store implementations for 
in memory storage and persistent storage on top of the Berkeley DB. 

More information is avaiable on the project webpage:

The rdfextras project offers several additional stores as well as a 
SPARQL engine for use with rdflib:
