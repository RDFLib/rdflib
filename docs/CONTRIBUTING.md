# Contributing Guide

Thank you for considering contributing to RDFLib. Contributors should understand and agree with 
the RDFLib Charter, below. 

## Charter

### Vision 

The RDFLib community wishes to provide a free and open source toolkit for the manipulation
of RDF data. 

This provision is for the community and by the community with contributors giving
their time and skills freely and asking for nothing in return, other than acknowledgements 
of them as contributors.

The toolkit is released for use under the [BSD 3-Clause License](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause)
to be as permissible as possibly: users can do what they wish with the toolkit.

### Scope

The community implements what it perceives to be core RDF manipulation functions within the RDFLib main
library. It also implements specifications related to RDF, such as the SPARQL Query Language, 
SHACL the Shapes Validation Language, RDFS and OWL reasoning and the parsing and 
serialisation of RDF file formats. Some of these related implementations are modules 
within RDFLib, others are stand-alone repositories within the RDFLib family. See <https://rdflib.dev>
for a listing.

The community encourages implementers of other RDFLib-related libraries to communicate them to us. 

### Membership

There are no restrictions on users of, and contributors to RDFLib, therefore there is no strict 
membership category. We ask only that contributors contribute according to the various technical 
protocols in the [Developers guide](./developers.md) and the [Documentation guide](./docs.md).

### Governance

RDFLib had been governed by an evolving set of core developers over its 20+ year lifetime. There are 
no strict rules as to who is or isn't a core developer and the recent practice for organisation has been
for the most involved developers to contact the mailing list and recent contributors directly to discuss
major releases and other issues.

If you would like to be involved in core development and/or governance, please just create an Issue in 
the issue tracker about this, or contact the most active developers and/or the mailing list.
