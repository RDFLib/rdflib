# Upgrading from RDFLib version 4.2.2 to 5.0.0

RDFLib version 5.0.0 appeared over 3 years after the previous release, 4.2.2 and contains a large number of both enhancements and bug fixes. Fundamentally though, 5.0.0 is compatible with 4.2.2.

## Major Changes

### Literal Ordering

Literal total ordering [PR #793](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/793) is implemented. That means all literals can now be compared to be greater than or less than any other literal. This is required for implementing some specific SPARQL features, but it is counter-intuitive to those who are expecting a TypeError when certain normally-incompatible types are compared. For example, comparing a `Literal(int(1), datatype=xsd:integer)` to `Literal(datetime.date(10,01,2020), datatype=xsd:date)` using a `>` or `<` operator in rdflib 4.2.2 and earlier, would normally throw a TypeError, however in rdflib 5.0.0 this operation now returns a True or False according to the Literal Total Ordering according the rules outlined in [PR #793](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/793)

### Removed RDF Parsers

The RDFa and Microdata format RDF parsers were removed from rdflib. There are still other python libraries available to implement these parsers.
