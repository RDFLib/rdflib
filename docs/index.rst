  * and JSON-LD, via a plugin module

* **Store implementations**

  * for in-memory and persistent RDF storage - Berkeley DB

* **Graph interface**

  * to a single graph
  * or a conjunctive graph (multiple named graphs)
  * or a dataset of graphs

* **SPARQL 1.1 implementation**

  * supporting both Queries and Updates
