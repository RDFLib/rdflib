While we prefer that PRs follow our\r\nguidelines, we will not reject PRs solely on the basis that they do not, though\r\nwe may take longer to process them as in most cases the remaining work will\r\nhave to be done by someone else.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding our guidelines, submit the PR as is\r\nand ask.\r\n\r\nMore detailed guidelines for pull requests are provided in our [developers\r\nguide](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/blob/main/docs/developers.rst).\r\n\r\nPRs that are smaller in size and scope will be reviewed and merged quicker, so\r\nplease consider if your PR could be split up into more than one independent part\r\nbefore submitting it, no PR is too small.

This project has no formal\r\nfunding or full-time maintainers, and relies entirely on independent\r\ncontributors to keep it alive and relevant.\r\n\r\nThis pull request template includes some guidelines intended to help\r\ncontributors, not to deter contributions. While we prefer that PRs follow our\r\nguidelines, we will not reject PRs solely on the basis that they do not, though\r\nwe may take longer to process them as in most cases the remaining work will\r\nhave to be done by someone else.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding our guidelines, submit the PR as is\r\nand ask.\r\n\r\nMore detailed guidelines for pull requests are provided in our [developers\r\nguide](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/blob/main/docs/developers.rst).\r\n\r\nPRs that are smaller in size and scope will be reviewed and merged quicker, so\r\nplease consider if your PR could be split up into more than one independent part\r\nbefore submitting it, no PR is too small. The maintainers of this project may\r\nalso split up larger PRs into smaller, more manageable PRs, if they deem it\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nPRs should be reviewed and approved by at least two people other than the author\r\nusing GitHub's review system before being merged. This is less important for bug\r\nfixes and changes that don't impact runtime behaviour, but more important for\r\nchanges that expand the RDFLib public API. Reviews are open to anyone, so please\r\nconsider reviewing other open pull requests, as this will also free up the\r\ncapacity required for your PR to be reviewed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Summary of changes\r\n\r\nlxml is at 6.0.1.  rdflib 7.1.4 builds with that version of lxml.  Update pypproject.toml accordingly.  Tested locally with python 3.9 and 3.11.\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Checked that there aren't other open pull requests for\r\n  the same change.\r\n- [x] Checked that all tests and type checking passes (same pytest tests pass or fail with lxml5 as lxml6).\r\n- If the change adds new features or changes the RDFLib public API:\r\n  <!-- This can be removed if the change does not affect users of this project. -->\r\n  - [ ] Added or updated tests that fail without the change.\r\n  - [ ] Updated relevant documentation to avoid inaccuracies.\r\n  - [x] Considered adding additional documentation.  (didn't see any documentation that needed updating)\r\n- [x] Considered granting [push permissions to the PR branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork),\r\n  so maintainers can fix minor issues and keep your PR up to date.\r\n\r\n",

This allows the rules to move more imports into <code>TYPE_CHECKING</code> blocks (<code>TC001</code>, <code>TC002</code>, and <code>TC003</code>), use PEP 604 union syntax on Python versions before 3.10 (<code>RUF013</code>), and unquote more annotations (<code>UP037</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Full module paths are now used to verify first-party modules</strong></p>\n<p>Ruff now checks that the full path to a module exists on disk before categorizing it as a first-party import. This change makes first-party import detection more accurate, helping to avoid false positives on local directories with the same name as a third-party dependency, for example. See the <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruff-determine-which-of-my-imports-are-first-party-third-party-etc\">FAQ section</a> on import categorization for more details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deprecated rules must now be selected by exact rule code</strong></p>\n<p>Ruff will no longer activate deprecated rules selected by their group name or prefix. As noted below, the two remaining deprecated rules were also removed in this release, so this won't affect any current rules, but it will still affect any deprecations in the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The deprecated macOS configuration directory fallback has been removed</strong></p>\n<p>Ruff will no longer look for a user-level configuration file at <code>~/Library/Application Support/ruff/ruff.toml</code> on macOS. This feature was deprecated in v0.5 in favor of using the <a href=\"https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/\">XDG specification</a> (usually resolving to <code>~/.config/ruff/ruff.toml</code>), like on Linux.

While we prefer that PRs follow our\r\nguidelines, we will not reject PRs solely on the basis that they do not, though\r\nwe may take longer to process them as in most cases the remaining work will\r\nhave to be done by someone else.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding our guidelines, submit the PR as is\r\nand ask.\r\n\r\nMore detailed guidelines for pull requests are provided in our [developers\r\nguide](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/blob/main/docs/developers.rst).\r\n\r\nPRs that are smaller in size and scope will be reviewed and merged quicker, so\r\nplease consider if your PR could be split up into more than one independent part\r\nbefore submitting it, no PR is too small. The maintainers of this project may\r\nalso split up larger PRs into smaller, more manageable PRs, if they deem it\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nPRs should be reviewed and approved by at least two people other than the author\r\nusing GitHub's review system before being merged. This is less important for bug\r\nfixes and changes that don't impact runtime behaviour, but more important for\r\nchanges that expand the RDFLib public API.

This should be backwards-compatible.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBriefly explain what changes the pull request is making and why. Ideally, this\r\nshould cover all changes in the pull request, as the changes will be reviewed\r\nagainst this summary to ensure that the PR does not include unintended changes.\r\n\r\nPlease also explicitly state if the PR makes any changes that are not backwards\r\ncompatible.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf an item on this list doesn't apply to your pull request, just remove it.\r\n\r\nIf, for some reason, you can't check some items on the checklist, or you are\r\nunsure about them, submit your PR as is and ask for help.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Checked that there aren't other open pull requests for\r\n  the same change.\r\n- [x] Checked that all tests and type checking passes. \u21d2 Other tests (sparql) fail on Python 3.14, see #3083 \r\n- If the change adds new features or changes the RDFLib public API: n/a\r\n- If the change has a potential impact on users of this project: n/a (covered by existing tests)\r\n- [x] Considered granting [push permissions to the PR branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork),\r\n  so maintainers can fix minor issues and keep your PR up to date.\r\n\r\n",

This project has no formal\r\nfunding or full-time maintainers, and relies entirely on independent\r\ncontributors to keep it alive and relevant.\r\n\r\nThis pull request template includes some guidelines intended to help\r\ncontributors, not to deter contributions. While we prefer that PRs follow our\r\nguidelines, we will not reject PRs solely on the basis that they do not, though\r\nwe may take longer to process them as in most cases the remaining work will\r\nhave to be done by someone else.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding our guidelines, submit the PR as is\r\nand ask.\r\n\r\nMore detailed guidelines for pull requests are provided in our [developers\r\nguide](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/blob/main/docs/developers.rst).\r\n\r\nPRs that are smaller in size and scope will be reviewed and merged quicker, so\r\nplease consider if your PR could be split up into more than one independent part\r\nbefore submitting it, no PR is too small. The maintainers of this project may\r\nalso split up larger PRs into smaller, more manageable PRs, if they deem it\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nPRs should be reviewed and approved by at least two people other than the author\r\nusing GitHub's review system before being merged. This is less important for bug\r\nfixes and changes that don't impact runtime behaviour, but more important for\r\nchanges that expand the RDFLib public API.

This is plain wrong.\r\n\r\nThe change removes datetime casting for `xsd:gYear` and `xsd:gYearMonth` for `rdflib.Literal.toPython` and adapts the `rdflib.Literal` tests accordingly.\r\n\r\nNote that validation of `xsd:gYear` and `xsd:gYearMonth` is lost as a result, but could be easily implemented using regex checks. As I understand it, XSD types without an entry in the `rdflib.term.XSDToPython` mapping are never typed-checked though; at least for `xsd:gYear` and `xsd:gYearMonth` the xsd-type checks ran as part of `rdflib.xsd_datetime.parse_xsd_gyear` and `rdflib.xsd_datetime.parse_xsd_gyearmonth`. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBriefly explain what changes the pull request is making and why.

This project has no formal\r\nfunding or full-time maintainers, and relies entirely on independent\r\ncontributors to keep it alive and relevant.\r\n\r\nThis pull request template includes some guidelines intended to help\r\ncontributors, not to deter contributions. While we prefer that PRs follow our\r\nguidelines, we will not reject PRs solely on the basis that they do not, though\r\nwe may take longer to process them as in most cases the remaining work will\r\nhave to be done by someone else.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding our guidelines, submit the PR as is\r\nand ask.\r\n\r\nMore detailed guidelines for pull requests are provided in our [developers\r\nguide](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/blob/main/docs/developers.rst).\r\n\r\nPRs that are smaller in size and scope will be reviewed and merged quicker, so\r\nplease consider if your PR could be split up into more than one independent part\r\nbefore submitting it, no PR is too small. The maintainers of this project may\r\nalso split up larger PRs into smaller, more manageable PRs, if they deem it\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nPRs should be reviewed and approved by at least two people other than the author\r\nusing GitHub's review system before being merged. This is less important for bug\r\nfixes and changes that don't impact runtime behaviour, but more important for\r\nchanges that expand the RDFLib public API. Reviews are open to anyone, so please\r\nconsider reviewing other open pull requests, as this will also free up the\r\ncapacity required for your PR to be reviewed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Summary of changes\r\n\r\nChange the typing of `Graph.triples_choices` and `Store.triples_choises`\r\nto match the actual types allowed by the code.\r\n\r\nThe two non-list parameters can be `None`, but this is not reflected in\r\nthe type hint today.\r\n\r\nIntroduce a type alias to simplify method signatures, and update all\r\noverloads of `triples_choises` to use this alias.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBriefly explain what changes the pull request is making and why. Ideally, this\r\nshould cover all changes in the pull request, as the changes will be reviewed\r\nagainst this summary to ensure that the PR does not include unintended changes.\r\n\r\nPlease also explicitly state if the PR makes any changes that are not backwards\r\ncompatible.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf an item on this list doesn't apply to your pull request, just remove it.\r\n\r\nIf, for some reason, you can't check some items on the checklist, or you are\r\nunsure about them, submit your PR as is and ask for help.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [\u2713] Checked that there aren't other open pull requests for\r\n  the same change.\r\n- [\u2713] Checked that all tests and type checking passes.\r\n  - Did not run webtests (`pytest -m \"not webtest\"`), since I could not get them working at all.\r\n    `7266 passed, 61 skipped, 333 deselected, 330 xfailed, 36 xpassed, 6925 warnings`\r\n- [\u2713] Considered granting [push permissions to the PR branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork),\r\n  so maintainers can fix minor issues and keep your PR up to date.\r\n\r\n",
