RDFLib
======

RDFLib is a Python library for working with RDF, a simple yet 
powerful language for representing information as graphs.

RDFLib may be installed with setuptools (easy_install) or pip::

    $ easy_install rdflib
or

    $ pip install rdflib

Getting Started
---------------

RDFLib aims to be a pythonic RDF API, a Graph is a python collection
of RDF Subject,Predicate,Object Triples: 

```python
import rdflib
g=rdflib.Graph()
g.load('http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semantic_Web')

for s,p,o in g: 
  print s,p,o
```

The components of the triples are URIs (resources) or Literals
(values), URIs are grouped together by *namespace*, common namespaces are 
included in RDFLib: 

```python

semweb=rdflib.URIRef('http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semantic_Web')
type=g.value(semweb, rdflib.RDFS.label) 
```

Where `rdflib.RDFS` is the RDFS Namespace, `graph.value` returns an
object of the triple-pattern given (or an arbitrary one if more
exist). New Namespaces can also be defined:

```python

dbpedia=Namespace('http://dbpedia.org/ontology/')

abstracts=list(x for x in g.objects(semweb, dbpedia['abstract']) if x.language=='en')
```

See also *./examples*


Features 
--------

The library contains parsers and serializers for RDF/XML, N3,
NTriples, N-Quads, Turtle, TriX, RDFa and Microdata.

The library presents a Graph interface which can be backed by
any one of a number of Store implementations. 

This core RDFLib package includes store implementations for 
in memory storage and persistent storage on top of the Berkeley DB. 

A SPARQL 1.1 implementation is included - supporting SPARQL 1.1 Queries and Update statements. 

RDFLib is open source and is maintained on [GitHub](http://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/). RDFLib releases, current and previous 
are listed on [PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/rdflib/)

RDFLib has a plugin-architecture for store-implementation, as well as parsers/serializers, several other projects exist which extend RDFLib features:

 * [rdflib-json](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib-jsonld) - Serializer and parser for [json-ld](http://json-ld.org)
