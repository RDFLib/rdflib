Testing with Nose
=================

This test runner uses Nose for test discovery and running. It uses the argument
spec of Nose, but with some options pre-set. To begin with, make sure you have
Nose installed, e.g.:

    $ pip nose doctest-ignore-unicode

For daily test runs, use:

    $ ./run_tests.py

If you supply attributes, the default ones defined in ``DEFAULT_ATTRS`` will be
ignored. So to run e.g. all tests marked ``slowtest`` or ``non_standard_dep``,
do:

    $ ./run_tests.py -a slowtest,non_standard_dep

See <http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/> for furher details. An excellent
article is also available at <http://ivory.idyll.org/articles/nose-intro.html>.

Note that this is just a convenience script. You can use ``nosetests`` directly
if it's on $PATH, with the difference that you have to supply the options
pre-set here manually.

Coverage
========

If ``coverage.py`` is placed in $PYTHONPATH, it can be used to create coverage
information (using the built-in coverage plugin of Nose) if the default
option "--with-coverage" is supplied (which also enables some additional
coverage options).

See <http://nedbatchelder.com/code/modules/coverage.html> for details.
