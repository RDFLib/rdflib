Data Access Working Group SPARQL Query Language test suite reorganization

This directory contains restructured copies of tests from
the DAWG test suite (available at
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/tests/data/). The purpose of this
restructuring is to enhance usability, clear away obsolete tests and
provide an up-to-date, consistent and easy to use suite of test cases
that SPARQL query language implementors can use to evaluate their
implementation. 


The Working Group decided 
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2007JulSep/att-0096/21-dawg-minutes.html#item05)
on 21 Aug 2007 that the tests as-is constitute a test suite that the group will
use to generate an implementation report for the SPARQL Query Language for
RDF.
