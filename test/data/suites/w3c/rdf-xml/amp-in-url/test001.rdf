  Description: the purpose of this test case is to show
  how one of XML's Predefined Entities - in this case the
  ampersand - is represented when it is used in the value of
  an rdf:about attribute.  The ampersand is represented
  by its numeric character reference as specified in:

   http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-predefined-ent

  In the associated N-Triples file, the ampersand will be
  represented with a single ampersand character (and not the
  ampersand's numeric character reference).

  Note: when a XML/HTML browser is used to display this file,
  a single ampersand character may be displayed and not the
  ampersand's numeric character reference.  In this case, the
  browser may provide an alternate way to view the file (such
  as viewing the file's source or saving to a file).
