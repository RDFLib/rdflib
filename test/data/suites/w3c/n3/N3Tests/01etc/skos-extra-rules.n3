# "2008-07-01: [rrs] RESOLVED: issue-73 is resolved by skos:exactMatch is disjoint with skos:broaderTransitive and skos:related -- http://www.w3.org/2008/07/01-swd-minutes.html#item05"
# SKOS Specification considers skos:exactMatch, skos:broadMatch as disjoint, corresponding constraint check rule is contained in http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2003/03swap/skos-rules.

# Detect the cycle in the hierarchical relation.
# "For many applications where knowledge organization systems are used, a cycle in the hierarchical relation represents a potential problem."
# However, in SKOS specification, "there is no condition requiring that skos:broaderTransitive be irreflexive. "
# Nevertheless, in the spec, it is suggested to use the form X skos:broaderTransitive X for finding cycles in the hierarchical relation.
# see details in: http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#L2484
# This rule is better use together with SKOS inference rule, e.g. http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2003/03swap/skos-rules
