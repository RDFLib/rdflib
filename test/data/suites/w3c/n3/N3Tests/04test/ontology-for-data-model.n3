            NOTE Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the basis for legal time worldwide
            and follows TAI (see below) exactly except for an integral number of seconds,
            presently 32. These leap seconds are inserted on the advice of the
            International Earth Rotation Service (IERS) (http://hpiers.obspm.fr) to
            ensure that, on average over the years, the Sun is overhead within 0.9
            seconds of 12:00:00 UTC on the meridian of Greenwich. UTC is thus the modern
            successor of Greenwich Mean Time, GMT, which was used when the unit of time
            was the mean solar day. International Atomic Time (TAI) is calculated by the
            BIPM from the readings of more than 200 atomic clocks located in metrology
            institutes and observatories in more than 30 countries around the world. TAI
            is made available every month in the BIPM Circular T
            (ftp://62.161.69.5/pub/tai/publication). It is estimated that TAI does not
            lose or gain with respect to an imaginary perfect clock by more than about
            one tenth of a microsecond (0.0000001 second) per year.
