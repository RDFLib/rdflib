# `rdf-xml.patch` notes

Some tests are commented out in
<https://www.w3.org/2013/RDFXMLTests/manifest.ttl>. These test pass with our
test runner and cover functionality in the RDF/XML parser that is not otherwise
covered.

This patch directory contains a manifest that has the commented-out tests
restored, but is otherwise identical.
