"""
This example demonstrates how to use `Python audit hooks
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.addaudithook>`_ to block access
to files and URLs.

It installs a audit hook with `sys.addaudithook <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.addaudithook>`_ that blocks access to files and
URLs that end with ``blocked.jsonld``.

The code in the example then verifies that the audit hook is blocking access to
URLs and files as expected.
