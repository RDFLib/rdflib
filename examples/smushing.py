"""
A FOAF smushing example.

Filter a graph by normalizing all ``foaf:Persons`` into URIs based on
their ``mbox_sha1sum``.

Suppose I get two `FOAF <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1>`_ documents each
talking about the same person (according to ``mbox_sha1sum``) but they
each used a :class:`rdflib.term.BNode` for the subject. For this demo
I've combined those two documents into one file:

This filters a graph by changing every subject with a
``foaf:mbox_sha1sum`` into a new subject whose URI is based on the
``sha1sum``. This new graph might be easier to do some operations on.

An advantage of this approach over other methods for collapsing BNodes
is that I can incrementally process new FOAF documents as they come in
without having to access my ever-growing archive. Even if another
``65b983bb397fb71849da910996741752ace8369b`` document comes in next
year, I would still give it the same stable subject URI that merges
with my existing data.
