"""
An example illustrating how to use the
:meth:`~rdflib.graph.Graph.transitive_subjects` and
:meth:`~rdflib.graph.Graph.transitive_objects` graph methods

Formal definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :meth:`~rdflib.graph.Graph.transitive_objects` method finds all
nodes such that there is a path from subject to one of those nodes
using only the predicate property in the triples. The
:meth:`~rdflib.graph.Graph.transitive_subjects` method is similar; it
finds all nodes such that there is a path from the node to the object
using only the predicate property.

Informal description, with an example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In brief, :meth:`~rdflib.graph.Graph.transitive_objects` walks forward
in a graph using a particular property, and
:meth:`~rdflib.graph.Graph.transitive_subjects` walks backward. A good
example uses a property ``ex:parent``, the semantics of which are
biological parentage. The
:meth:`~rdflib.graph.Graph.transitive_objects` method would get all
the ancestors of a particular person (all nodes such that there is a
parent path between the person and the object). The
:meth:`~rdflib.graph.Graph.transitive_subjects` method would get all
the descendants of a particular person (all nodes such that there is a
parent path between the node and the person). So, say that your URI is
``ex:person``.

This example would get all of your (known) ancestors, and then get all
the (known) descendants of your maternal grandmother.

.. warning:: The :meth:`transitive_objects` method has the start node
    as the *first* argument, but the :meth:`transitive_subjects`
    method has the start node as the *second* argument.

User-defined transitive closures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The method :meth:`~rdflib.graph.Graph.transitiveClosure` returns
transtive closures of user-defined functions.
