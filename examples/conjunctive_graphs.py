"""
An RDFLib ConjunctiveGraph is an (unnamed) aggregation of all the named graphs
within a Store. The :meth:`~rdflib.graph.ConjunctiveGraph.get_context`
method can be used to get a particular named graph for use such as to add
triples to, or the default graph can be used

This example shows how to create named graphs and work with the
conjunction (union) of all the graphs.
