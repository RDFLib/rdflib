A Shining Panda instance for continuous integration and 
testing of RDFLib and RDFExtras is at:

RDFLib 3.2.X tries to be compatible with python versions 2.4 - 3

Some of the limitations we've come across:

 * no collections.defaultdict => a fall-back implementation is in rdflib/compat, import this instead
 * no 'yield' without arguments => use 'yield None' instead
 * no ternary if (no X if A else B) => rewrite with normal if
 * no context handlers, i.e. not 'with file('blah'): ' => rewrite
 * No skipping tests using unittest, i.e. TestCase.skipTest and decorators are missing => use nose instead

We may drop 2.4 compatability for rdflib 4.X, but for now try to make sure the tests pass under 2.4 !
