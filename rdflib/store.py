Types of store
--------------

``Context-aware``: An RDF store capable of storing statements within contexts
is considered context-aware. Essentially, such a store is able to partition
the RDF model it represents into individual, named, and addressable
sub-graphs.

Relevant Notation3 reference regarding formulae, quoted statements, and such:
http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html

``Formula-aware``: An RDF store capable of distinguishing between statements
that are asserted and statements that are quoted is considered formula-aware.

``Transaction-capable``: capable of providing transactional integrity to the
RDF operations performed on it.

``Graph-aware``: capable of keeping track of empty graphs.
