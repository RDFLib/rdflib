You may use the PyLD project under the terms of the New BSD License.

The New BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy
to understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with
the PyLD project.

You are free to use this project in commercial projects as long as the
copyright header is left intact.

If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your
commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can
afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this
library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing
the PyLD software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of
thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping
the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative
commercial entities for our efforts.
