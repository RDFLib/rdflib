This is the equivalent of Atom's element as defined in Feed Paging and Archiving [RFC 5005](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5005), For example (and as defined for Atom), when using data from a feed that represents a collection of items that varies over time (e.g. "Top Twenty Records") there is no need to have newer entries mixed in alongside older, obsolete entries. By marking this feed as a CompleteDataFeed, old entries can be safely discarded when the feed is refreshed, since we can assume the feed has provided descriptions for all current items.

Note that in an emergency, such information may not always be reliable.
    CreateAction: URIRef  # The act of deliberately creating/producing/generating/building a result out of the agent.
    CreativeWork: URIRef  # The most generic kind of creative work, including books, movies, photographs, software programs, etc.

    CreativeWorkSeries: URIRef  # A CreativeWorkSeries in schema.org is a group of related items, typically but not necessarily of the same kind. CreativeWorkSeries are usually organized into some order, often chronological. Unlike [[ItemList]] which is a general purpose data structure for lists of things, the emphasis with CreativeWorkSeries is on published materials (written e.g. books and periodicals, or media such as tv, radio and games).\n\nSpecific subtypes are available for describing [[TVSeries]], [[RadioSeries]], [[MovieSeries]], [[BookSeries]], [[Periodical]] and [[VideoGameSeries]]. In each case, the [[hasPart]] / [[isPartOf]] properties can be used to relate the CreativeWorkSeries to its parts. The general CreativeWorkSeries type serves largely just to organize these more specific and practical subtypes.\n\nIt is common for properties applicable to an item from the series to be usefully applied to the containing group. Schema.org attempts to anticipate some of these cases, but publishers should be free to apply properties of the series parts to the series as a whole wherever they seem appropriate.

    CriticReview: URIRef  # A [[CriticReview]] is a more specialized form of Review written or published by a source that is recognized for its reviewing activities. These can include online columns, travel and food guides, TV and radio shows, blogs and other independent Web sites. [[CriticReview]]s are typically more in-depth and professionally written. For simpler, casually written user/visitor/viewer/customer reviews, it is more appropriate to use the [[UserReview]] type. Review aggregator sites such as Metacritic already separate out the site's user reviews from selected critic reviews that originate from third-party sources.

For example, a common tactic is using an unaltered image but saying it came from a different time or place. (An image rated 'original' can also be missing context.)  For an [[ImageObject]] with embedded text to be 'missing context': An unaltered image presented in an inaccurate manner to misrepresent the image and mislead the viewer. For example, a common tactic is using an unaltered image but saying it came from a different time or place. (An 'original' image with inaccurate text would generally fall in this category.)  For an [[AudioObject]] to be 'missing context': Unaltered audio presented in an inaccurate manner that misrepresents it. For example, using incorrect dates or locations, or sharing brief clips from a longer recording to mislead viewers. (Audio rated “original” can also be missing context.)

It can be considered the [[result]] of an [[EndorseAction]] in which the [[object]] of the action is rated positively by some [[agent]]. As is common elsewhere in schema.org, it is sometimes more useful to describe the results of such an action without explicitly describing the [[Action]].  An [[EndorsementRating]] may be part of a numeric scale or organized system, but this is not required: having an explicit type for indicating a positive, endorsement rating is particularly useful in the absence of numeric scales as it helps consumers understand that the rating is broadly positive.
    Energy: URIRef  # Properties that take Energy as values are of the form '&lt;Number&gt; &lt;Energy unit of measure&gt;'.
    EnergyConsumptionDetails: URIRef  # EnergyConsumptionDetails represents information related to the energy efficiency of a product that consumes energy.

    EventSeries: URIRef  # A series of [[Event]]s. Included events can relate with the series using the [[superEvent]] property.  An EventSeries is a collection of events that share some unifying characteristic. For example, "The Olympic Games" is a series, which is repeated regularly. The "2012 London Olympics" can be presented both as an [[Event]] in the series "Olympic Games", and as an [[EventSeries]] that included a number of sporting competitions as Events.  The nature of the association between the events in an [[EventSeries]] can vary, but typical examples could include a thematic event series (e.g. topical meetups or classes), or a series of regular events that share a location, attendee group and/or organizers.  EventSeries has been defined as a kind of Event to make it easy for publishers to use it in an Event context without worrying about which kinds of series are really event-like enough to call an Event. In general an EventSeries may seem more Event-like when the period of time is compact and when aspects such as location are fixed, but it may also sometimes prove useful to describe a longer-term series as an Event.

    SpecialAnnouncement: URIRef  # A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped textual information update       with contextualized Web links and other structured data.  It represents an information update made by a       locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,       local government.  For work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#).  The motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the [Coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic), and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to our usual [Github entry](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490), feedback comments can also be provided in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#).   While this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol), although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover the kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation.  Several kinds of information can be provided:  We encourage the provision of "name", "text", "datePosted", "expires" (if appropriate), "category" and "url" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for "category" where possible, most ideally as a well known URL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20\_coronavirus\_pandemic" or "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910".  For many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description, use a [[WebContent]] type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple "[[text]]" summary of the page. It is unlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.  We expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, [[openingHours]], [[Event]], [[FAQPage]] etc. By linking to those pages from a [[SpecialAnnouncement]] you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the [[category]] property of the [[SpecialAnnouncement]].  Many [[SpecialAnnouncement]]s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use [[spatialCoverage]] for the region, and [[announcementLocation]] to indicate specific [[LocalBusiness]]es and [[CivicStructure]]s. If the announcement affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both [[spatialCoverage]] and [[announcementLocation]].  The [[about]] property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the announcement. We now recommend using [[about]] only for representing non-location entities (e.g. a [[Course]] or a [[RadioStation]]). For places, use [[announcementLocation]] and [[spatialCoverage]]. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of /about for locations too.  The basic content of [[SpecialAnnouncement]] is similar to that of an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be shared by posting [[SpecialAnnouncement]] updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed with the [[webFeed]] property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline [[DataFeed]] object, with [[encodingFormat]] providing media type information e.g. "application/rss+xml" or "application/atom+xml".

    SuperficialAnatomy: URIRef  # Anatomical features that can be observed by sight (without dissection), including the form and proportions of the human body as well as surface landmarks that correspond to deeper subcutaneous structures. Superficial anatomy plays an important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure).

    speakable: URIRef  # Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech.  The *speakable* property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values:  1.) *id-value* URL references - uses *id-value* of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of *speakable* has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.  2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the [[cssSelector]] property.  3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the [[xpath]] property.   For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, [[SpeakableSpecification]]  which is defined to be a possible value of the *speakable* property.
