This will be the last RDFLib release to support python 2.5.

* The RDF/XML Parser was made stricter, now raises exceptions for
  illegal repeated node-elements.
  [#363](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/363)

2013/12/31 RELEASE 4.1
======================

This is a new minor version RDFLib, which includes a handful of new features:

* A TriG parser was added (we already had a serializer) - it is
  up-to-date wrt. to the newest spec from: http://www.w3.org/TR/trig/

* The Turtle parser was made up to date wrt. to the latest Turtle spec.

* Many more tests have been added - RDFLib now has over 2000
  (passing!) tests. This is mainly thanks to the NT, Turtle, TriG,
  NQuads and SPARQL test-suites from W3C. This also included many
  fixes to the nt and nquad parsers.

* ```ConjunctiveGraph``` and ```Dataset``` now support directly adding/removing
  quads with ```add/addN/remove``` methods.

* ```rdfpipe``` command now supports datasets, and reading/writing context
  sensitive formats.

* Optional graph-tracking was added to the Store interface, allowing
  empty graphs to be tracked for Datasets. The DataSet class also saw
  a general clean-up, see: [#309](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/309)

* After long deprecation, ```BackwardCompatibleGraph``` was removed.

Minor enhancements/bugs fixed:
------------------------------

* Many code samples in the documentation were fixed thanks to @PuckCh

* The new ```IOMemory``` store was optimised a bit

* ```SPARQL(Update)Store``` has been made more generic.

* MD5 sums were never reinitialized in ```rdflib.compare```

* Correct default value for empty prefix in N3
  [#312](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/312)

* Fixed tests when running in a non UTF-8 locale
  [#344](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/344)

* Prefix in the original turtle have an impact on SPARQL query
  resolution
  [#313](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/313)

* Duplicate BNode IDs from N3 Parser
  [#305](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/305)

* Use QNames for TriG graph names

  [#335](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/335)

* A way to limit the number of triples retrieved from the
  ```SPARQLStore``` was added
  [#346](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/pull/346)

* Dots in localnames in Turtle
  [#345](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/345)
  [#336](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/336)

* ```BNode``` as Graph's public ID
  [#300](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/300)

* Introduced ordering of ```QuotedGraphs```
  [#291](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/291)

2013/05/22 RELEASE 4.0.1
========================

Following RDFLib tradition, some bugs snuck into the 4.0 release.
This is a bug-fixing release:

* the new URI validation caused lots of problems, but is
  nescessary to avoid ''RDF injection'' vulnerabilities. In the
  spirit of ''be liberal in what you accept, but conservative in
  what you produce", we moved validation to serialisation time.

* the   ```rdflib.tools```   package    was   missing   from   the
  ```setup.py```  script, and  was therefore  not included  in the
  PYPI tarballs.

* RDF parser choked on empty namespace URI
  [#288](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/288)

* Parsing from ```sys.stdin``` was broken
  [#285](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/285)

* The new IO store had problems with concurrent modifications if
  several graphs used the same store
  [#286](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/286)

* Moved HTML5Lib dependency to the recently released 1.0b1 which
  support python3

2013/05/16 RELEASE 4.0
======================

This release includes several major changes:

* The new SPARQL 1.1 engine (rdflib-sparql) has been included in
  the core distribution. SPARQL 1.1 queries and updates should
  work out of the box.

  * SPARQL paths are exposed as operators on ```URIRefs```, these can
    then be be used with graph.triples and friends:

    ```py
    # List names of friends of Bob:
    g.triples(( bob, FOAF.knows/FOAF.name , None ))

    # All super-classes:
    g.triples(( cls, RDFS.subClassOf * '+', None ))
    ```

      * a new ```graph.update``` method will apply SPARQL update statements

* Several RDF 1.1 features are available:
  * A new ```DataSet``` class
  * ```XMLLiteral``` and ```HTMLLiterals```
  * ```BNode``` (de)skolemization is supported through ```BNode.skolemize```,
    ```URIRef.de_skolemize```, ```Graph.skolemize``` and ```Graph.de_skolemize```

* Handled of Literal equality was split into lexical comparison
  (for normal ```==``` operator) and value space (using new ```Node.eq```
  methods). This introduces some slight backwards incomaptible
  changes, but was necessary, as the old version had
  inconsisten hash and equality methods that could lead the
  literals not working correctly in dicts/sets.
  The new way is more in line with how SPARQL 1.1 works.
  For the full details, see:

  https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/wiki/Literal-reworking

* Iterating over ```QueryResults``` will generate ```ResultRow``` objects,
  these allow access to variable bindings as attributes or as a
  dict. I.e.

  ```py
  for row in graph.query('select ... ') :
     print row.age, row["name"]
  ```

* "Slicing" of Graphs and Resources as syntactic sugar:
  ([#271](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/271))

  ```py
  graph[bob : FOAF.knows/FOAF.name]
            -> generator over the names of Bobs friends
  ```

* The ```SPARQLStore``` and ```SPARQLUpdateStore``` are now included
  in the RDFLib core

* The documentation has been given a major overhaul, and examples
  for most features have been added.


Minor Changes:
--------------

* String operations on URIRefs return new URIRefs: ([#258](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/258))
  ```py
  >>> URIRef('http://example.org/')+'test
  rdflib.term.URIRef('http://example.org/test')
  ```

* Parser/Serializer plugins are also found by mime-type, not just
  by plugin name:  ([#277](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/277))
* ```Namespace``` is no longer a subclass of ```URIRef```
* URIRefs and Literal language tags are validated on construction,
  avoiding some "RDF-injection" issues ([#266](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/266))
* A new memory store needs much less memory when loading large
  graphs ([#268](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/268))
* Turtle/N3 serializer now supports the base keyword correctly ([#248](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/248))
* py2exe support was fixed ([#257](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/257))
* Several bugs in the TriG serializer were fixed
* Several bugs in the NQuads parser were fixed

2013/03/01 RELEASE 3.4
======================

This release introduced new parsers for structured data in HTML.
In particular formats: hturtle, rdfa, mdata and an auto-detecting
html format were added.  Thanks to Ivan Herman for this!

This release includes a lot of admin maintentance - correct
dependencies for different python versions, etc.  Several py3 bugs
were also fixed.

This release drops python 2.4 compatability - it was just getting
too expensive for us to maintain. It should however be compatible
with any cpython from 2.5 through 3.3.

* ```node.md5_term``` is now deprecated, if you use it let us know.

* Literal.datatype/language are now read-only properties ([#226](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/226))
* Serializing to file fails in py3 ([#249](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/249))
* TriX serializer places two xmlns attributes on same element ([#250](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/250))
* RDF/XML parser fails on when XML namespace is not explicitly declared ([#247](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/247))
* Resource class should "unbox" Resource instances on add ([#215](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/215))
* Turtle/N3 does not encode final quote of a string ([#239](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/239))
* float Literal precision lost when serializing graph to turtle or n3 ([#237](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/237))
* plain-literal representation of xsd:decimals fixed
* allow read-only sleepycat stores
* language tag parsing in N3/Turtle fixes to allow several subtags.

2012/10/10 RELEASE 3.2.3
========================

Almost identical to 3.2.2
A stupid bug snuck into 3.2.2, and querying graphs were broken.

* Fixes broken querying ([#234](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/234))
* graph.transitiveClosure now works with loops ([#206](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/206))

2012/09/25 RELEASE 3.2.2
========================

This is mainly a maintenance release.

This release should be compatible with python 2.4 through to 3.

Changes:

* Improved serialization/parsing roundtrip tests led to some fixes
  of obscure parser/serializer bugs. In particular complex string
  Literals in ntriples improved a lot.
* The terms of a triple are now asserted to be RDFLib Node's in graph.add
  This should avoid getting strings and other things in the store. ([#200](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/200))
* Added a specific TurtleParser that does not require the store to be
  non-formula aware. ([#214](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/214))
* A trig-serializer was added, see:
  http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/trig/
* BNode generation was made thread-safe ([#209](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/209))
  (also fixed better by dzinxed)
* Illegal BNode IDs removed from NT output: ([#212](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/212))
* and more minor bug fixes that had no issues

2012/04/24 RELEASE 3.2.1
========================

This is mainly a maintenance release.

Changes:

* New setuptools entry points for query processors and results

* Literals constructed from other literals copy datatype/lang ([#188](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/188))
* Relative URIs are resolved incorrectly after redirects ([#130](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/130))
* Illegal prefixes in turtle output ([#161](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/161))
* Sleepcat store unstable prefixes ([#201](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/201))
* Consistent toPyton() for all node objects ([#174](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/174))
* Better random BNode ID in multi-thread environments ([#185](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/issues/185))

* Thanks to Thomas Kluyver, rdflib now works under python3,
  the setup.py script automatically runs 2to3.

* Unit tests were updated and cleaned up. Now all tests should pass.

  Store SPARQL Support


2010/05/13 RELEASE 3.0.0
========================

Working test suite with all tests passing.

Removed dependency on setuptools.

(Issue #43) Updated Package and Module Names to follow
conventions outlined in
http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Removed SPARQL bits and non core plugins. They are mostly
moving to http://code.google.com/p/rdfextras/ at least until
they are stable.

Fixed datatype for Literal(True).

Fixed Literal to enforce contraint of having either a language
or datatype but not both.

Fixed Literal's repr.

Fixed to Graph Add/Sub/Mul opterators.

Upgraded RDFa parser to pyRdfa.

Upgraded N3 parser to the one from CWM.

Fixed unicode encoding issue involving N3Parser.

N3 serializer improvments.

Fixed HTTP content-negotiation

Fixed Store.namespaces method (which caused a few issues
depending on Store implementation being used.)

Fixed interoperability issue with plugin module.

Fixed use of Deprecated functionality.

2009/03/30 RELEASE 2.4.1
========================

Fixed Literal comparison case involving Literal's with
datatypes of XSD.base64Binary.

Fixed case where XSD.date was matching before XSD.dateTime for
datetime instances.

Fixed jython interoperability issue (issue #53).

Fixed Literal repr to handle apostrophes correctly (issue #28).

Fixed Literal's repr to be consistent with its ```__init__``` (issue #33).


2007/04/04 RELEASE 2.4.0
========================

Improved Literal comparison / equality

Sparql cleanup.

getLiteralValue now returns the Literal object instead of the
result of toPython().  Now that Literals override a good
coverage of comparison operators, they should be passed around
as first class objects in the SPARQL evaluation engine.

Added support for session bnodes re: sparql

Fixed prolog reduce/reduce conflict.  Added Py_None IncRefs
where they were being passed into Python method invokations
(per drewp's patch)

Fixed sparql queries involving empty namespace prefix.

Fixed the selected variables sparql issue

Fixed <BASE> support in SPARQL queries.

Fixed involving multiple unions and queries are nested more
than one level (bug in _getAllVariables causing failure when
parent.top is None)

Fixed test_sparql_equals.py.

Fixed sparql json result comma errors issue.

Fixed test_sparql_json_results.py (SELECT * variables out of
order)

Added a 4Suite-based SPARQL XML Writer implementation.  If
4Suite is not installed, the fallback python saxutils is used
instead

applied patch from
http://rdflib.net/issues/2007/02/23/bugs_in_rdflib.sparql.queryresult/issue

The restriction on GRAPH patterns with variables has been
relieved a bit to allow such usage when the variable is
provided as an initial binding

Fix for OPTIONAL patterns.  P1 OPT P2, where P1 and P2 shared
variables which were bound to BNodes were not unifying on
these BNode variable efficiently / correctly.  The fix was to
add bindings for 'stored' BNodes so they aren't confused for
wildcards




Added support to n3 parser for retaining namespace bindings.

Fixed several RDFaParser bugs.

Added serializer specific argument support.

Fixed a few PrettyXMLSerializer issues and added a max_depth
option.

Fixed some TurtleSerializer issues.

Fixed some N3Serializer issues.

Added rdflib_tools package
  Added rdfpipe
  Added initial EARLPluging



Improved test running... using nose... added tests

Exposed generated test cases for nose to find.
added bit to configure 'setup.py nosetests' to run doc tests

added nose test bits



Added md5_term_hash method to terms.

Added commit_pending_transaction argument to Graph's close
method.

Added DeprecationWarning to rdflib.constants

Added a NamespaceDict class for those who want to avoid the
Namespace as subclass of URIRef issues

Added bind function

Fixed type of Namespace re: URIRef vs. unicode

Improved ValueError message

Changed value method's any argument to default to True

Changed ```__repr__``` to always reflect that it's an rdf.Literal --
as this is the case even though we now have it acting like the
corresponding type in some casses

A DISTINCT was added to the SELECT clause to ensure duplicate
triples are not returned (an RDF graph is a set of triples) -
which can happen for certain join expressions.

Support for ConditionalAndExpressionList and
RelationalExpressionList (|| and && operators in FILTER)

Fixed context column comparison.  The hash integer was being
compared with 'F' causing a warning:Warning: Truncated
incorrect DOUBLE value: 'F'

applied patch in
http://rdflib.net/issues/2006/12/13/typos_in_abstractsqlstore.py/issue

fix for
http://rdflib.net/issues/2006/12/07/problems_with_graph.seq()_when_sequences_contain_more_than_9_items./issue





General code cleanup (removing redundant imports, changing
relative imports to absolute imports etc)

Removed usage of deprecated bits.

Added a number of test cases.

Added DeprecationWarning for save method

refactoring of GraphPattern

ReadOnlyGraphAggregate uses Graph constructor properly to
setup (optionally) a common store


Fixed bug with . (fullstop) in localname parts.

Changed Graph's value method to return None instead of raising
an AssertionError.

Fixed conversion of (exiplicit) MySQL ports to integers.

Fixed MySQL store so it properly calculates ```__len__``` of
individual Graphs

Fixed query result ```__len__``` (more efficient).

Fixed and improved RDFa parser.

decoding method (ascii) was hitting certain characters.

Changed Graph's bind method to also override the binding in
the case of an existing generated bindings.

Added FOPLRelationalModel - a set of utility classes that
implement a minimal Relational Model of FOPL implemented as a

improvements.

Added more test cases.

Cleaned up source code to follow pep8 / pep257.

2005/12/23 RELEASE 2.3.0
========================

See http://rdflib.net/2.3.0/ for most up-to-date release notes

Added N3 support to Graph and Store.

Added Sean's n3p parser, and ntriples parser.

Sleepycat implementation has been revamped in the process of
expanding it to support the new requirements n3
requirements. It also now persists a journal -- more to come.

detabified source files.

Literal and parsers now distinguish between datatype of None and datatype of "".

Store-agnostic 'fallback' implementation of REGEX matching
(inefficient but provides the capability to stores that don't
support it natively). Implemented as a 'wrapper' around any
Store which replaces REGEX terms with None (before dispatching
to the store) and whittles out results that don't match the
given REGEX term expression(s).

Store-agnostic 'fallback' implementation of transactional
rollbacks (also inefficient but provides the capablity to
stores that don't support it natively). Implemented as a
wrapper that tracks a 'thread-safe' list of reversal
operations (for every add, track the remove call that reverts
the store, and vice versa). Upon store.rollback(), execute the
reverse operations. However, this doesn't guarantee
durability, since if the system fails before the rollbacks are
all executed, the store will remain in an invalid state, but
it provides Atomicity in the best case scenario.


2005/10/10 RELEASE 2.2.3
========================

Fixed Sleepycat backend to commit after an add and
remove. This should help just a bit with those unclean
shutdowns ;)

Fixed use of logging so that it does not mess with the root
logger. Thank you, Arve, for pointing this one out.

Fixed Graph's value method to have default for subject in
addition to predicate and object.

Fixed Fourthought backend to be consistent with interface. It
now supports an empty constructor and an open method that
takes a configuration string.


2005/09/10 RELEASE 2.2.2
========================

Applied patch from inkel to add encoding argument to all
serialization related methods.

Fixed XMLSerializer bug regarding default namespace bindings.

Fixed namespace binding bug involving binding a second default
namespace.

Applied patch from Gunnar AAstrand Grimnes to add context
support to ```__iadd__``` on Graph. (Am considering the lack of
context support a bug. Any users currently using ```__iadd__```, let
me know if this breaks any of your code.)

Added Fourthought backend contributed by Chimezie Ogbuji.

Fixed a RDF/XML parser bug relating to XMLLiteral and
escaping.

Fixed setup.py so that install does not try to uninstall
(rename_old) before installing; there's now an uninstall
command if one needs to uninstall.

There is now a remove and a remove_triples (no more overloaded
remove).

Layer 2 has been merged with layer 1 since there is no longer a
need for them to be separate layers.

The generate_uri method has moved to LoadSave since triple stores
do not have a notion of a uri. [Also, with proper bNode support on
its way the need for a generate_uri might not be as high.]

Fixed bug in node's n3 function: URI -> URIRef.

Replaced string based exceptions with class based exceptions.
